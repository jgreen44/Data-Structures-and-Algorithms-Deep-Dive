## Selection Sort:


1. In-place algorithm (in-place algorithm is an algorithm which transforms input using no auxiliary data structure)
2. O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity - quadratic
3. It will take:    100 steps to sort 10 items,
   10,000 steps to sort 100 items,
   1,000,000 steps to sort 1000 items
4. Doesn't require as much swapping as bubble sort
5. Unstable algorithm
